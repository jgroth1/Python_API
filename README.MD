# Python API Analysis:

## Purpouse:

Pourpose of this project is to use the Openweathermap api to get weather information for 500 cities and compare that information to the latitude of the the cities.

## Analysis:

1. Only temperature showed a trend when compared to the latitudes. 
2. the higher the absolute value of the of the latitude in general the lower the temperature was. With the highest temperatures at or near the equator.
3. The other measures showed no relationship to the latitude.  
4. The other measures showed a gamma like distribution of values over the whole range of latitudes except cloudiness which showed a more uniform distribution.
